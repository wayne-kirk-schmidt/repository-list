General Project Listing
=======================

This is designed to be a launching point for different work I have done in 
security, devops, specific programming languages, and thoughts on systems.

This will have links to different projects, which are organized into:

`1) coding projects - this will have code, installation instructions
 2) design projects - these will have mind maps, drawings, documents
 3) deploy projects - a how-to on how to integrate components into a system
